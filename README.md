# File-to-Video

To address file storage issues, I am developing a developed repository that will enable users to convert any type of file into a video format. 
This solution will not only make it easier to store and manage files.

By creating this repository, I aim to provide a more streamlined and efficient solution for managing data hiding the data as well. 
The ability to convert files into a standardized video format will make it easier to access and share files across different platforms and devices.

Furthermore, this repository will be useful for anyone who deals with large amounts of data on a regular basis, such as researchers, educators, or business professionals. 
By providing a more efficient and effective way to manage files, this repository will help users save time and resources, while also improving their overall productivity.

AKA ISG (written entirely in Rust my beloved) lets you embed files into video and upload them to youtube as storage.

This has been quite heavily inspired by suckerpinch's [Harder Drive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JcJSW7Rprio) video and [discord as a filesystem](https://github.com/pixelomer/discord-fs). Unfortunately no filesystem functionality as of right now.

# Now, you might be asking yourself:

<details>
<summary><b>But is this against YouTube TOS ?</b></summary>
<b>Answer is:</b> probably?

I don't speak legalese. Depending on the interpretation of "Autogenerated content that computers post without regard for quality or viewer experience" from [community guidelines](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2801973?hl=en#) this could be a violation. The TOS also mention circumventing the service which this tool probably does. Use at your own risk. I don't advise using this tool for anything serious/large. YouTube might understandably get mad, even though the videos might be private. Treat this less like the next dropbox and more like a "party trick".

# Installation
## The source way (building from source with manually installing dependencies)

=== *Please note: building from source takes **a lot of CPU and RAM** usage.* ===\
You need to have installed:
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) 
- [opencv](https://github.com/twistedfall/opencv-rust)

If having any issues also try installing this:
- [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/)
- [clang](https://clang.llvm.org/)
- [qt](https://github.com/qt)

If you want to or already have went through the hassle of installing Rust, you can ```git clone``` this repository, then ```cargo build --release```.
Cd to `/target/release` directory and run the program `./isg_4real`.

## The easiest way (Docker)

Trying to make anything work on other people's computers is a nightmare so I'll use docker from now on

1. Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) if you haven't already.
2. Clone this repository `git clone https://github.com/Vignesh-N-0/File_to_Video.git`
3. Change into the repository `cd File_to_Video`
4. Run `docker build -t isg .` to build the docker image.
5. Run `docker run -it --rm -v ${PWD}:/home/File_to_Video isg cargo build --release` to build the project.

That's it. You will find the executable in the `target/release` directory. 

ℹ️ **Please Note:** The binary will be a linux executable, so you will need to run it in a linux environment.
If you do not have a linux environment, you can use [Install Linux on Windows with WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10) 
or run it using the docker container called `isg` we just built **using a Linux shell or PowerShell**:

```bash
docker run -it --rm -v ${PWD}:/home/File_to_Video isg ./target/release/isg_4real
```

**Note:** If you are using `cmd` on Windows, you will need to use `%cd%` instead of `${PWD}`.

## Usage
-------------
1. Archive to zip all the files you will be uploading
2. Run the executable
3. Use the embed option on the archive (**THE VIDEO WILL BE SEVERAL TIMES LARGER THAN THE FILE**, 4x in case of optimal compression resistance preset)
4. Upload the video to your YouTube channel. You probably want to keep it up as unlisted
5. Use the download option to get the video back
6. Use the dislodge option to get your files back from the downloaded video
7. PROFIT

Try to use the program on this video and find the files hidden inside.

***No it's not just a rick roll.***

Explanation 4 nerds
-------------
The principle behind this is pretty simple. All files are made of bytes and bytes can be interpreted as numbers ranging from 0-255. This number can be represented with pixels using one of two modes: RGB or binary.

**RGB**:
The cooler mode. Every byte perfectly fits inside one of the colors of an rgb pixel. One rgb pixel can contain 3 bytes at a time. You just keep adding pixels like this until you run out of data. It is leagues more efficient and quick than binary.

**Binary**:
Born from YouTube compression being absolutely brutal. RGB mode is very sensitive to compression as a change in even one point of one of the colors of one of the pixels dooms the file to corruption. Black and white pixels are a lot harder to mess up. Every pixel is either bright representing a 1 or dark representing a 0. We string these bits together to get bytes and continue until we run out of data. 

Both of these modes can be corrupted by compression, so we need to increase the size of the pixels to make it less compressable. 2x2 blocks of pixels seem to be good enough in binary mode.

To make it easier on the user, we also include all the relevant settings used to create the video on the first frame of the video. This allows the program to know what mode the video is in and what size to use in order to avoid making the user remember.

# Make use of this in an efficient way.
